# Installation

## Stable release

To install ruleminer, run this command in your terminal:

```console
pip install ruleminer
```

This is the preferred method to install ruleminer, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.
